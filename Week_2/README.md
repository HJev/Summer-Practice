### Problem 1 (Derivative and Integral)
Given a **Polynomial**, compute its derivative and integral.  
For example:
> $2x^2 + 4x + 5$  
> Derivative: $4x + 4$  
> Integral: $\frac{2}{3}x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x + C$

If you want, you can make these visually appealing and symbolic, but for simplicity, you can also represent input and output as vectors.  
For example:  
> $2x^2 + 4x + 5$  
> $[2, 4, 5]$

### Problem 2 (Riemann Sum)
Numerically compute the integral of a curve using the Riemann Sum method.  
Here is a fun curve to try it on:  
> $e^{-(x^2)}$
